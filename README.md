First of all. I'm trying not to lorem ipsum this, also for the fact that menu didn't appear on typing lorem, so it may not be available in this file type.

I have completed all the assignment of The Odin Project till now. 

My mouse arrived 2 days ago, headphones arrived today, keyboard will probably arrive tomorrow, so I'm kind of over in my head. 
I believe this is all the HTML, though I haven't learnt <b> <i> <u><br>, I guess its not html but css. So, I'll be eager to learn those.

Linux is very light, gives quite a good battery life on my gaming laptop.

*secret note: Since not many people know about the Odin Project, so I feel gratitude towards the person on the Telegram channel about tech that told me and kind of feel superior from my classmates.
